This personal website is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. It features a custom, responsive theme designed to be lightweight and fast, operating without JavaScript to enhance performance and maximize browser compatibility. To streamline content management, several pages are automatically updated through a workflow action which reduces time spent on manual updates and ensures the site stays current. The live version, which primarily serves as my personal portfolio, can be accessed [here](https://matt-santos.github.io/index).

This is a test of an image include with link

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
