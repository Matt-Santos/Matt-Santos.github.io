This personal website is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. It features a custom, responsive theme designed to be lightweight and fast, operating without JavaScript to enhance performance and maximize browser compatibility. To streamline content management, several pages are automatically updated through a workflow action which reduces time spent on manual updates and ensures the site stays current. The live version, which primarily serves as my personal portfolio, can be accessed [here](https://matt-santos.github.io/index).
