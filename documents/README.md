This personal website is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. It features a custom, responsive theme designed to be lightweight and fast, operating with minimal JavaScript to enhance performance and maximize browser compatibility. To streamline content management, several pages are automatically updated through a workflow action which reduces time spent on manual updates and ensures the site stays current. There is also support for rendering electronic design files and 3d models. The live version, which primarily serves as my personal portfolio, can be accessed [here](https://matt-santos.github.io/index).
