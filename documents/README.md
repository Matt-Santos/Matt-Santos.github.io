This personal website is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages, featuring a custom, responsive theme that is both lightweight and visually appealing. The design leverages modern HTML5 and CSS4 techniques for optimal browser compatibility, with minimal JavaScript (ie: [glightbox](https://biati-digital.github.io/glightbox/), [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [KICanvas](https://github.com/theacodes/kicanvas)) used solely to enhance the user experience. Liquid is extensively employed for content management, automatically populating galleries, file listings, and project pages by pulling data from project repositories through a custom workflow. Additionally, all site settings and critical content are centralized in a config file, greatly streamlining the update process. The site also supports experimental browser based rendering of schematics, 3D models, and other dynamic content. The live version, serving as my personal portfolio, can be accessed [here](https://matt-santos.github.io/index). Suggestions for improvement are always welcome.
